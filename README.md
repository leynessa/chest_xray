# chest_xray
 this is a project put on by the Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging Society of SÃ£o Paulo (SPR) and with Amazon Web Services. 
 The challenge is to create a model capable of predicting the patient's gender and age group through chest X-rays. 
 To ensure the success of this activity, SPR invited institutions to collaborate with the donation of tens of thousands of images;
 which allows participants to create artificial intelligence algorithms to indicate the gender and age of the patient. <br><br>
